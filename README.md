# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the end project of this course and is about wearable computing problem.
The data are from UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
<br/>It is a Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings 
of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded 
inertial sensors.
<br/>In this repo you will find this **README**, a **CODEBOOK** which try to explain the variables, the structure of the dataset and some code information, the 
**run_analysis.R** code that create a tidy new dataset written based on the instruction of this assignment and the result of this code named **tidydata.txt**. 

The code istructions are:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
